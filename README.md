# API documentation for ISP and IPP

The main API documentaion is [vipps-invoice-api.md](https://github.com/vippsas/vipps-invoice-api/blob/master/vipps-invoice-api.md). This is [frequently updated](https://github.com/vippsas/vipps-invoice-api/commits/master/vipps-invoice-api.md), and issues and PRs are welcome.

## Test users

This test user can receive invoices, and approve, etc:

## Test issuers

The service validates that the account belongs to the issuer ([KAR](https://www.finansnorge.no/aktuelt/presentasjoner/bankenes-felles-konto--og-adresseregister-kar/)). Make sure that that you use a valid pair when testing.
